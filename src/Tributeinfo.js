            <h1>Kendrick Lamar</h1>
         <p id="tribute-info">Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper, 
            songwriter, and record producer. He is regarded by many critics and contemporaries 
            as one of the most important and influential rappers of his generation, and as one of the 
            greatest rappers of all time. Raised in Compton, California, Lamar embarked on 
            his musical career as a teenager under the stage name K-Dot, releasing a mixtape that garnered 
            local attention and led to his signing with indie record label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). 
            He began to gain recognition in 2010 after his first retail release, Overly Dedicated. 
            The following year, he independently released his first studio album, Section.80, which 
            included his debut single "HiiiPoWeR". By that time, he had amassed a large online following and 
            collaborated with several prominent hip hop artists, including The Game, Busta Rhymes, and Snoop Dogg.
            Lamar's major label debut album, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, was released in 2012 by TDE, Aftermath, and 
            Interscope Records to critical acclaim. It debuted at No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was later 
            certified platinum by the RIAA. The record contained the top 40 singles "Swimming Pools (Drank)", 
            "Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe", and "Poetic Justice". His critically acclaimed third album To Pimp a 
            Butterfly (2015) incorporated elements of funk, soul, jazz, and spoken word. It debuted atop the 
            charts in the U.S. and the UK, and won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 58th ceremony. 
            In 2016, Lamar released Untitled Unmastered, a collection of unreleased demos that originated during 
            the recording sessions for To Pimp a Butterfly. He released his fourth album, Damn, in 2017 to further 
            acclaim; its lead single "Humble" topped the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the album itself became 
            the first non-classical and non-jazz album to be awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music.
            Aside from his solo career, Lamar is also known as a member of the hip hop supergroup Black Hippy, 
            alongside his TDE label-mates Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, and Schoolboy Q. He has received many accolades over the 
            course of his career, including 13 Grammy Awards and an Academy Award nomination. In 2012, MTV named him 
            the "Hottest MC in the Game" on their annual list.Time named him one of the 100 most influential 
            people in the world in 2016. </p>
